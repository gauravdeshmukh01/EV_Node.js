# Infosys Finacle EdgeVerve PDA Training – Node.js & Express.js

This repository is a part of the **Infosys Finacle EdgeVerve PDA Training** program and focuses on hands-on learning and real-world implementation of **Node.js and Express.js**, two of the most powerful technologies used for building fast, scalable, and enterprise-grade backend applications.

---

## Repository Overview

This repository includes:

- Core JavaScript for backend development  
- Server creation using Node.js  
- REST API development using Express.js  
- Routing and middleware concepts  
- Request and response handling  
- CRUD operations  
- Error handling and validation  
- Mini projects and real-world use cases  

The structure of this repository follows a **module-based learning approach**, making it ideal for step-by-step backend development practice.

## What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform **JavaScript runtime environment** that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside the browser. It is widely used for building fast and scalable backend applications.

### Key Features of Node.js:

- **Non-blocking, asynchronous architecture**
- **High performance using the V8 engine**
- **Single-threaded but highly scalable**
- **Large ecosystem using NPM (Node Package Manager)**
- **Ideal for real-time applications and APIs**

---

## What is Express.js?

**Express.js** is a lightweight, fast, and flexible **web application framework for Node.js**. It simplifies server-side development and is widely used for building **RESTful APIs** and web applications.

### Key Features of Express.js:

- **Simple and minimal framework**
- **Powerful routing system**
- **Middleware support**
- **Easy integration with databases**
- **Fast API development**

Together, **Node.js + Express.js** form one of the most demanded backend technology stacks in the industry.
