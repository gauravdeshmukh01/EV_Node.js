* Node.js Security

(1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability typically found in web applications. 
It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites. 
When users visit the compromised web page, the malicious scripts are executed in their browsers, 
potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other harmful actions.

(2) Code Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert
malicious code into a program or system. This can happen when user input is not properly
validated or sanitized, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, manipulate data,
or gain unauthorized access to the system.
To prevent this vulnerability, it is essential to implement strong input validation,
sanitize user inputs, and use parameterized queries for database interactions.
